# LikeNtfsWalker
ToyProject_Like NTFSwalker

※It's not a completed project.※

The project is a Toy Project created by imitating NTFS Walker, which implements the function of checking the MFT Entry of NTFS filesystem and the function of extracting the data of the entry.

It is a project that supports the GUI that I participated in for the first time, and there are many shortcomings.
The function to close Stream, Hex Viewer function, PreViewer function, etc. are not implemented.

I would like to thank my friends and mentor for working on this project that is not so fun.
